Current release: [v0.1.0-alpha](https://github.com/s0lst1c3/dropengine/releases/tag/v0.1.-alpha)

Supports _Python 3.7+_.

# Overview

Defense Evasion techniques tend to have a short shelf-life, and this is especially true for techniques used during initial access. Because of this, initial access payloads are often prepared on a per-engagement  basis, which can be time-consuming when payloads are created entirely by hand. DropEngine addresses this problem by providing a malleable framework for creating shellcode runners, allowing operators to choose from a selection of components and combine them to create highly sophisticated payloads within seconds.

Available payload components include crypters, execution and injection mechanisms, as well as environmental nad remote keying functions. Also included are pre-execution modules such as sandbox checks and AMSI bypasses. Although these pre-packaged example modules may prove useful, DropEngine's true strength is in its ability to improve operational efficiency by providing a high degree of payload standardization while simultaneously allowing operators to control just about every aspect of the payload's signature and behavior.
